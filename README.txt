The bones of a tile-based, 2d platforming game written in vanilla java.

This was written mostly to understand the basics of a game engine, from the game loop to the mechanics of sprite
rendering. The code and art is all original.

I used Killer Game Programming (https://www.amazon.com/Killer-Game-Programming-Andrew-Davison/dp/0596007302) as a
refrence for the game loop.
